Exploring Swift through algorithms, patterns, and playgrounds: LeetCode, AoC, and beyond.

This repository contains some exploration of Swift through hands-on problem solving. It includes solutions to algorithmic challenges (e.g., LeetCode, Advent of Code), language experiments, and examples of idiomatic Swift using modern patterns and best practices.


## üîç Why This Exists
I created this repository to:

* Sharpen my problem-solving skills in Swift
* Explore the language's modern features and concurrency model
* Demonstrate engineering discipline through test-driven development and clean code
* Build a reference library of idiomatic Swift solutions


## üß© What You'll Find Here
### ‚ú® Algorithms & Problem Solving
* LeetCode challenges with testable, idiomatic Swift solutions
* Daily puzzles from Advent of Code, showcasing parsing, recursion, graph traversal, and more


### üî¨ Language Experiments
* Swift concurrency (e.g., async/await, structured concurrency)
* Value vs reference semantics
* Protocol-oriented programming
* SwiftUI and Combine mini-prototypes


### üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Discipline
* Solutions written with clarity, readability, and testability in mind
* Test coverage using Swift Testing
* Use of modern tooling such as Swift Package Manager
